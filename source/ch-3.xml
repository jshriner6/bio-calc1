  <introduction permid="PXA">
    <p permid="HnI">
      Among all functions, linear functions are simplest.
      One of the powerful consequences of a function
      <m>y = f(x)</m> being differentiable at a point <m>(a,f(a))</m> is that,
      up close,
      the function <m>y = f(x)</m> is locally linear and looks like its tangent line at that point.
      In certain circumstances,
      this allows us to approximate the original function <m>f</m> with a simpler function <m>L</m> that is linear:
      this can be advantageous when we have limited information about <m>f</m> or when <m>f</m> is computationally or algebraically complicated.
      We will explore all of these situations in what follows.
    </p>

    <p permid="nuR">
      It is essential to recall that when <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x = a</m>,
      the value of <m>f'(a)</m> provides the slope of the tangent line to
      <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      If we know both a point on the line and the slope of the line we can find the equation of the tangent line and write the equation in point-slope form<fn>
      Recall that a line with slope <m>m</m> that passes through
      <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> has equation <m>y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)</m>,
      and this is the <em>point-slope form</em> of the equation.

    <title>The tangent line</title>
    <idx><h>tangent line</h><h>equation</h></idx>

    <p permid="TCa">
      Given a function <m>f</m> that is differentiable at <m>x = a</m>,
      we know that we can determine the slope of the tangent line to <m>y = f(x)</m> at
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> by computing <m>f'(a)</m>.
      The equation of the resulting tangent line is given in point-slope form by
      <me permid="pke">
        y - f(a) = f'(a)(x-a) \ \ \text{or} \ \ y = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)
      </me>.
      Note well: there is a major difference between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(x)</m> in this context.
      The former is a constant that results from using the given fixed value of <m>a</m> (called the <term>center</term>),
      while the latter is the general expression for the rule that defines the function.
      The same is true for <m>f'(a)</m> and <m>f'(x)</m>:
      we must carefully distinguish between these expressions.
      Each time we find the tangent line,
      we need to evaluate the function and its derivative at the <em>center</em>: a fixed <m>a</m>-value.
    </p>

    <p permid="zJj">
      In <xref ref="F-1-8-TanLine">Figure</xref>,
      we see the graph of a function <m>f</m> and its tangent line at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      Notice how when we zoom in we see the local linearity of <m>f</m> more clearly highlighted.
      The function and its tangent line are nearly indistinguishable up close.
      <!-- Local linearity can also be seen dynamically in <url href="https://gvsu.edu/s/6J" visual="gvsu.edu/s/6J">this applet</url>. -->

    <p permid="LXB">
      A slight change in perspective and notation will enable us to be more precise in discussing how the tangent line approximates <m>f</m> near <m>x = a</m>.
      By solving for <m>y</m>,
      we can write the equation for the tangent line as
      <me permid="Vrn">
        y = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)
      </me>
      This line is itself a function of <m>x</m>.
      Replacing the variable <m>y</m> with the expression <m>L(x)</m>, we call
      <me permid="Byw">
        L(x) = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)
      </me>
      <notation><usage><m>L(x)</m></usage><description>The linear approximation of a function centered at an <m>x</m> value</description></notation>
      the <term>linear approximation of <m>f</m>
      centered at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m></term>. We may also use the terms <term>tangent line approximation of <m>f</m></term> or <term>local linearization of <m>f</m></term> to reference the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
      In this notation,
      <m>L(x)</m> is nothing more than a new name for the tangent line.
      As we saw above, for <m>x</m> close to the center <m>a</m>,
      <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <example permid="DJi">
      <statement>
        <p permid="bgz">
          Suppose that a function
          <m>y = f(x)</m> has its tangent line approximation given by
          <m>L(x) = 3 - 2(x-1)</m> centered at the point <m>(1,3)</m>,
          but we do not know anything else about the function <m>f</m>.
          To estimate a value of <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x</m> near 1, such as <m>f(1.2)</m>,
          we can use the fact that <m>f(1.2) \approx L(1.2)</m> and hence
          <me permid="hFF">
            f(1.2) \approx L(1.2) = 3 - 2(1.2-1) = 3 - 2(0.2) = 2.6

    </example>

    <p permid="seK">
      We emphasize that 
      <m>y = L(x)</m> is simply a new name for the tangent line function.
      Using this new notation and our observation
      that 
      <m>L(x) \approx f(x)</m> for <m>x</m> near <m>a</m>,
      it follows that we can write
      <me permid="NMO">

    <p permid="YlT">
      From <xref ref="act-1-8-1">Activity</xref>, we see that
      the local linearization <m>y = L(x)</m> is a linear function that shares two important values with the function
      <m>y = f(x)</m> that it is derived from.
      In particular,

      <ul permid="clS">
        <li permid="NcU">
          because <m>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</m>,
          it follows that <m>L(a) = f(a)</m>; and
        </li>

        <li permid="tkd">
          because <m>L</m> is a linear function,
          its derivative is its slope.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Hence, <m>L'(x) = f'(a)</m> for every value of <m>x</m>,
      and specifically <m>L'(a) = f'(a)</m>.
      Therefore, we see that <m>L</m> is a linear function that has both the same value and the same slope as the function <m>f</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Etc">
      Thus, if we know the linear approximation <m>y = L(x)</m> for a function,
      we know the original function's value and its slope at the point of tangency.
      What remains unknown, however,
      is the shape of the function <m>f</m> at the point of tangency.
      There are essentially four possibilities,
      as shown in <xref ref="F-1-8-Options">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-8-Options" permid="cVM">
      <caption>Four possible graphs for a nonlinear differentiable function and how it can be situated relative to its tangent line at a point.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/1_8_Options" >
      	<description>Four different graphs showing how a tangent line can be situated differently based on the concavity of the function. </description>
      </image>
    </figure>

    <p permid="kAl">
      These possible shapes result from the fact that there are three options for the value of the second derivative:
      either <m>f''(a) \lt 0</m>,
      <m>f''(a) = 0</m>, or <m>f''(a) \gt 0</m>.

      <ul permid="Itb">
        <li permid="Zrm">
          If <m>f''(a) \gt 0</m>,
          then we know the graph of <m>f</m> is concave up,
          and we see the first possibility on the left,
          where the tangent line lies entirely below the curve.
        </li>

        <li permid="Fyv">
          If <m>f''(a) \lt 0</m>,
          then <m>f</m> is concave down and the tangent line lies above the curve,
          as shown in the second figure.
        </li>

        <li permid="lFE">
          If <m>f''(a) = 0</m> and <m>f''</m> changes sign at <m>x = a</m>,
          the concavity of the graph will change,
          and we will see either the third or fourth figure.<fn>
          It is possible that
          <m>f''(a) = 0</m> but <m>f''</m> does not change sign at <m>x = a</m>,
          in which case the graph will look like one of the first two options.
          </fn>.
        </li>

        <li permid="RMN">
          A fifth option (which is not very interesting)
          can occur if the function <m>f</m> itself is linear,
          so that <m>f(x) = L(x)</m> for all values of <m>x</m>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p permid="QHu">
      The plots in <xref ref="F-1-8-Options">Figure</xref>
      highlight yet another important thing that we can learn from the concavity of the graph near the point of tangency:
      whether the tangent line lies above or below the curve itself.
      This is key because it tells us whether or not the tangent line approximation's values will be too large (an overestimate) or too small (an underestimate) in comparison to the true value of <m>f</m>.
      For instance,
      in the first situation in the leftmost plot in <xref ref="F-1-8-Options">Figure</xref> where <m>f''(a) > 0</m>,
      because the tangent line falls below the curve,
      we know that <m>L(x) \le f(x)</m> for all values of <m>x</m> near <m>a</m>.

    <p permid="wOD">
      The idea that a differentiable function looks linear and can be well-approximated by a linear function is an important one that finds wide application in calculus.
      Many applications that we will see in the remainder of this chapter rely on the concept of local linearity.
      One example is that it can help us to make further sense of certain challenging limits.
      For instance, we will see in <xref ref="sec-2-8-LHR">Section</xref> that the limit
      <me permid="tTX">
        \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
      </me>
      is an <em> indeterminate form</em>,
      because both its numerator and denominator tend to <m>0</m> This can make it challenging to know the value of the limit algebraically.
      While there is no algebra that we can do to simplify <m>\frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m>,
      it is straightforward to show that the linearization of
      <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m> at the point <m>(0,0)</m> is given by <m>L(x) = x</m>.
      Hence, for values of <m>x</m> near <m>0</m>, <m>\sin(x) \approx x</m>,
      and therefore
      <me permid="abg">
        \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \approx \frac{x}{x} = 1
      </me>,
      which makes plausible the fact that
      <me permid="Gip">
        \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1
      </me>.
      Indeed, we will develop further tools in <xref ref="sec-2-8-LHR">Section</xref> to see this is in fact the value of the limit.

	<title>Quadratic Approximation</title>
	<p>
	We have already seen that the second derivative can be useful information in determining the shape (concavity) of a function near a point when using the tangent line approximation to estimate a function's value near that point. We have also seen that the tangent line approximation <m>L(x)</m> is a <q>good</q> approximation of a function <m>f(x)</m> near its center because it has the same <m>y</m> value at the center (<m>f(a)=L(a)</m>) and it has the same slope at the center (<m>f'(a)=L'(a)</m>).  
	</p>
	<p>
	Instead of restricting ourselves to approximating with a line, we can similarly ask for the best <em>quadratic</em> function to use to approximate a function near a point. A benefit of using the graph of a parabola in approximation is that we can now ask not only that the approximation match the function's <m>y</m> value and first derivative, but also match the function's second derivative (concavity). The following activity will help us determine a general formula for the best quadratic function to use when approximating a function near a point.

          <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>?
          </question>
          <answer>
            The tangent line to a differentiable function <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point
            <m>(a,f(a))</m> is given in point-slope form by the equation
            <me permid="mpy">

          <question permid="OSh">What is the principle of local linearity and what is the linear approximation (or local linearization) of a differentiable function <m>f</m> at a point <m>(a,f(a))</m>?
          </question>
          <answer>
            The principle of local linearity tells us that if we zoom in on a point where a function <m>y = f(x)</m> is differentiable,
            the function will be indistinguishable from its tangent line.
            That is,
            a differentiable function looks linear when viewed up close.
            We rename the tangent line to be the function
            <m>y = L(x)</m>, where <m>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</m>.
            Thus,
            <m>f(x) \approx L(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> near <m>x = a</m>.

          <question permid="uZq">How does knowing just the tangent line approximation tell us information about the behavior of the original function itself near the point of approximation?
          </question>
          <answer>
            If we know the tangent line approximation
            <m>L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</m> to a function <m>y=f(x)</m>,
            then because <m>L(a) = f(a)</m> and <m>L'(a) = f'(a)</m>,
            we also know the values of both the function
            and its derivative at the point where <m>x = a</m>.
            In other words,
            the linear approximation tells us the height and slope of the original function.
          </answer>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<question>
	 How does knowing the second derivative's value at this point provide us additional knowledge of the original function's behavior?
	 </question>
	 <answer>
	 If, in addition, we know the value of <m>f''(a)</m>,
            we then know whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of
            <m>y = f(x)</m>, depending on the concavity of <m>f</m>. We also can compute the quadratic approximation of <m>f</m> centered at <m>a</m>,
            	<me>Q(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \dfrac{f''(a)}{2}(x-a)^2</me>,
	  which may provide us with even better approximations near the center <m>a</m>.

              With the information we have we can find the linearization of <m>s</m> at <m>t=9</m>,
              using the facts that <m>s(9) = 4</m> and <m>s'(9) = -1.2</m>.
              Thus, the linearization of <m>s</m> at <m>t=9</m> is <m>L(t) = 4 - 1.2(t-9)</m>.
              One use of the linearization is that for <m>t</m> close to <m>9</m>,

		In this section we will revisit an old question from <xref ref="sec-1-8">Section</xref>: given a DTDS with equilibrium value <m>x^*</m>, is <m>x^*</m> <em>stable</em> or <em>unstable</em>? Previously we used <xref ref="ssec-1-8-cob" text="custom">Cob-webbing</xref> to answer this question, which required graphing the updating function rule with the diagonal <m>y=x</m>. However, in this section we will see that the <em>derivative</em> is a useful tool that we can use to determine stability with or without the graph of the updating function rule.

		<title>Testing stability of equilibria using the derivative</title>
		<p>
			<xref ref="sec-1-8-tan-line-approx">Section</xref> introduced the concept of <em>local linearity</em>: a function whose derivative exists at an input value <m>a</m> resembles the tangent line at <m>a</m> for <m>x</m> values close to <m>a</m>. The stability of an equilibrium value is also a <em>local</em> property, since it is dependent on the cob-webbing behavior when using initial values that are close to the equilibrium value. Therefore, even though most updating function rules are not linear functions, when asking about the stability of an equilibrium value we can approximate the updating function rule using its tangent line at the associated equilibrium point. We expect the cob-webbing behavior using the tangent line to be qualitatively the same as if we used the updating function when using initial values that are close to the equilibrium value.
		</p>
		<p>
			<xref ref="wu-3-2">Warm-Up</xref> illustrates some examples of how we expect cob-webbing to behave with linear updating function rules, which is dependent on the slope of the linear updating function rule. We see that the stability of an equilibrium value depends on the <em>steepness</em> of the slope, and not on its <em>direction</em>. Indeed, playing with a few more examples may convince you that the slope of the diagonal line (<m>m=1</m>) is the right value to compare steepness to in order to determine the stability of an equilibrium value: if the slope of a linear updating function rule is less steep than <m>1</m>, the equilibrium value will be stable; if the slope of a linear updating function rule is steeper than <m>1</m>, the equilibrium value will be unstable. This observation, along with local linearity, gives us the following stability criteria based on the first derivative:
		</p>
		<p>
		Let <m>f</m> be the updating function rule for a DTDS with equilibrium value <m>x^*</m>.
		<ul>
			<li>If <m>|f'(x^*)| \lt 1</m>, then <m>x^*</m> is a stable equilibrium value.</li>
			<li>If <m>|f'(x^*)| \gt 1</m>, then <m>x^*</m> is an unstable equilibrium value.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<remark>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>We do not compare the actual value of the derivative at the equilibrium value to <m>1</m>, but the <em>absolute value</em> of the derivative at the equilibrium value. This reflects our observation that it is only the steepness of the line that impacts the stability, and not the direction of the line. </li>
					<li>The stability criteria given so far does not address the case when <m>|f'(x^*)|=1</m>. We will address this case in <xref ref="ssec-3-2-inconclusive">Subsection</xref>.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</remark>
		<p>
		While the direction of the tangent line (the sign of the slope) does not impact stability, it does tell us about other qualitative behavior of the solution function. You may notice in the examples of <xref ref="wu-3-2">Warm-Up</xref> that the cob-webbing associated with the negative-sloped updating functions looks different than that of the positive-sloped updating functions. We explore this difference in more detail in the following example.
		</p>
		<example>
			<title>Derivative Signs and Solution Behavior</title>
			<p>
			In <xref ref="wu-3-2">Warm-Up</xref> number 1, the updating function is <m>b_{t+1}= 2b_t -2</m>. Using an initial value of <m>b_0=2.5</m> and iterating the updating function produces the following table of values:
			<table>

							<cell>
								<m>10</m>
							</cell>
						</row>
					</tabular>
				</table>
				</p>
				<p>
				The table shows that the solution function values are trending away from <m>b^*=2</m>, which is unstable behavior. This is because the updating function rule is <m>f(x)=2x-2</m>, which means <m>f'(x)=2</m>. Using the stability criteria, we see that <m>|f'(2)| = |2| = 2</m>, which is greater than <m>1</m>, and so the equilibrium value <m>b^*=2</m> is unstable. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Further, we see the solution function is moving in one direction (increasing in this case) with each iteration. This is because <m>f'(2) \gt 0</m>.
				</p>

				In <xref ref="wu-3-2">Warm-Up</xref> number 4, the updating function is <m>b_{t+1}= -0.5b_t +3</m>. Using an initial value of <m>b_0=2.5</m> and iterating the updating function produces the following table of values:

				</p>
				<p>
				The table shows that the solution function values are trending towards <m>b^*=2</m>, which is stable behavior. This is because the updating function rule is <m>f(x)=-0.5x+3</m>, which means <m>f'(x)=-0.5</m>. Using the stability criteria, we see that <m>|f'(2)| = |-0.5| = 0.5</m>, which is less than <m>1</m>, and so the equilibrium value <m>b^*=2</m> is stable. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Further, we see the solution function is going back and forth between above and below the equilibrium value of <m>2</m> with each iteration. This is because <m>f'(2) \lt 0</m>.
				</p>
		</example>
		<p>
		The qualitative behavior of a solution going back and forth between above and below the equilibrium value is called <idx><h>oscillation</h></idx><term>oscillation</term>, and we've seen that the first derivative of an updating function rule can also help us determine when solution functions will oscillate around an equilibrium value. 
		</p>
		<assemblage>
			<title>Oscillation Criteria</title>
			<idx><h>oscillation</h><h>criteria</h></idx>
			<p>
			Let <m>f</m> be the updating function rule for a DTDS with equilibrium value <m>x^*</m>. If <m>f'(x^*) \lt 0</m>, then the solution function will oscillate around <m>x^*</m> when the initial value is close to <m>x^*</m>.
			</p>
		</assemblage>
		<p>
		It's important to note that the behaviors of <q>stability</q> and <q>oscillation</q> are not mutually exclusive. That is, it is possible for an equilibrium value to be stable with oscillatory behavior, unstable with oscillatory behavior, stable with non-oscillatory behavior, and unstable with non-oscillatory behavior.

		<title>An inconclusive case using the derivative</title>
		<p>
		The stability criteria provided so far does not tell us what happens when the derivative of an updating function rule at an equilibrium value is equal to <m>1</m> in absolute value. For the sake of examples, we will focus on the case when the derivative is equal to <m>1</m> (a similar discussion can be had when the derivative is equal to <m>-1</m>).
		</p>
		<p>
		This is an interesting case because if a DTDS has an equilibrium value <m>x^*</m>, then the graph of the updating function rule will intersect the diagonal line <m>x_{t+1}=x_t</m> at the point <m>(x^*,x^*)</m>. If the derivative of the updating function rule at <m>x^*</m> is equal to <m>1</m>, its tangent line has the same slope as the diagonal line. This means the tangent line intersects the diagonal line and has the same slope, which means the diagonal line is the tangent line to the updating function rule at the equilibrium point. We have seen in <xref ref="sec-1-8-tan-line-approx">Section</xref> that the way a function behaves around its tangent line at a point can vary depending on the second derivative at that point. We will use this as motivation in generating the two examples below.
		</p>
		<p>
		First consider the updating function <m>x_{t+1}= \sin(x_t)</m>. It can be verified algebraically that <m>x^*=0</m> is an equilibrium value. Note also that the updating function rule is <m>f(x)=\sin(x)</m>, so that <m>f'(x)=\cos(x)</m>. Therefore, <m>f'(0)= \cos(0) = 1</m>, which means this is a case in which the derivative of the updating function rule at the equilibrium value is equal to <m>1</m>. Use the interactive below to answer the questions before viewing the answers.
			<interactive desmos="l7lzh9l5g8" width="170%" aspect="2:1" preview="images/3_2_int_prev_stabthm1.png"/>
			<ul>
				<li>For initial values close to and greater than the equilibrium value, how does the solution function behave? 
					<answer>For initial values greater than <m>0</m>, cob-webbing shows that the solution function decreases towards <m>0</m>.</answer>
				</li>
				<li>For initial values close to and less than the equilibrium value, how does the solution function behave? 
					<answer>For initial values less than <m>0</m>, cob-webbing shows that the solution function increases towards <m>0</m>.</answer>
				</li>
				<li>Would you classify the equilibrium value as stable or unstable?
					<answer>Since the solution function values get closer and closer to the equilibrium value for initial values on either side of the equilibrium value, we would classify the equilibrium value as stable.</answer>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		Because of this example, we may be tempted to conclude that when the derivative of an updating function rule at an equilibrium value is equal to <m>1</m>, the equilibrium value is stable. A single example, however, cannot prove to us that this will always occur. The next example will show us that we can, in fact, get different behavior if we change the second derivative value of the updating function at the equilibrium value.  
		</p>
		<p>
		Now we consider the updating function <m>x_{t+1}=0.5(x_t)^2 = 0.5</m>. It can be verified algebraically that <m>x^*=1</m> is an equilibrium value. Note also that the updating function rule is <m>f(x)=0.5x^2 +0.5</m>, so that <m>f'(x)=x</m>. Therefore, <m>f'(1)=1</m>, which means this is a case in which the derivative of the updating function rule at the equilibrium value is equal to <m>1</m>. Use the interactive below to answer the questions before viewing the answers.

				<li>For initial values close to and greater than the equilibrium value, how does the solution function behave? 
					<answer>For initial values greater than <m>1</m>, cob-webbing shows that the solution function increases away from <m>1</m>.</answer>
				</li>
				<li>For initial values close to and less than the equilibrium value, how does the solution function behave? 
					<answer>For initial values less than <m>1</m>, cob-webbing shows that the solution function increases towards <m>1</m>.</answer>
				</li>
				<li>Would you classify the equilibrium value as stable or unstable?
					<answer>This is a case we have not seen yet. The behavior is different depending on which side of the equilibrium value the initial value is on. Since the solution function values do not approach the equilibrium value for initial values on both sides of the equilibrium value, we would classify this equilibrium value as having a special case of unstable behavior.</answer>

		<p>
		While we technically classify the last example as unstable behavior, we can be more descriptive by calling it <idx><h>equilibrium value</h><h>half-stable</h></idx> <term>half-stable</term>, since it displays stable behavior on one side of the equilibrium value and unstable behavior on the other side. 
		</p>
		<p>
		We have found two examples that both have updating functions rules whose derivative is equal to <m>1</m> at the equilibrium value, but they display very different behaviors in terms of stability. This means that in this particular case, the first derivative of the updating function does not hold enough information to tell us whether the equilibrium value is stable or unstable. In this case, we must use another method (like cob-webbing, or generating an appropriate table of values) to determine stability. We end this section by stating the stability criteria given earlier along with the inconclusive case in what we will call the <term>Stability Theorem</term>:

			<question>How can we use the first derivative to help classify equilibrium values as stable or unstable?</question>
			<answer>
			Due to local linearity of differentiable functions, the cob-webbing behavior for initial values near an equilibrium value can be analyzed by understanding the cob-webbing behavior of linear updating functions. This results in the following stability criteria for an updating function rule <m>f(x)</m> and an equilibrium value <m>x^*</m>:
				<ul>
					<li>If <m>|f'(x^*)| \lt 1</m>, then <m>x^*</m> is a stable equilibrium value.</li>
					<li>If <m>|f'(x^*)| \gt 1</m>, then <m>x^*</m> is an unstable equilibrium value.</li>
				</ul>
			Though the sign of the derivative does not impact stability, it can tell us whether a solution function will oscillate around its equilibrium value. Oscillation around <m>x^*</m> occurs when <m>f'(x^*) \lt 0</m>.
			</answer>
			</li>
			<li>
			<question> Can the first derivative always tell us whether an equilibrium value is stable or unstable?</question>
			<answer>
			No. If <m>|f'(x^*)| = 1</m>, then the stability theorem is inconclusive. Another method must be used to determine the stability of <m>x^*</m>.

			<p>
			In <xref ref="sec-1-9">Section</xref>, we analyzed two discrete-time dynamical systems, the lung model and the competing species model, using tools from <xref ref="ch-1">Chapter</xref>. In this section, we will again analyze an important discrete-time dynamical system, the logistic DTDS, using our newly developed tools involving the derivative from <xref ref="sec-3-2">Section</xref>. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In <xref ref="ssec-1-9-competing">Subsection</xref>, we modeled population growth with the updating function <m>p_{t+1} =rp_t</m>, where <m>r</m> represents the per capita reproduction rate. We know from <xref ref="sec-1-7">Section</xref> that a solution function associated with this updating function is exponential. While exponential growth can be a good model for population growth at first, over time it becomes unrealistic since exponential growth does not reflect limited resources or a carrying capacity that we observe with real populations over time. One use case for the logistic dynamical system is as a population model that takes into account the carrying capacity of a population.

		<subsection>
			<title>The logistic map</title>
			<p>
			Let <m>p_t</m> be the population size in year <m>t</m>, and <m>M</m> the maximum possible population size. We would like a model that reflects our observation that population growth slows as it gets nearer to <m>M</m>. We can achieve this by letting the per capita reproduction rate change as the population changes, as opposed to remaining constant as in the exponential model. To that end, if <m>r \gt 0</m> is the maximum possible per capita reproduction rate, we set the per capita reproduction rate at year <m>t</m> to be 
				<me>r_t = r\left(1- \dfrac{p_t}{M}\right)</me>. 
			Note that this has the desired effect of decreasing the per capita reproduction rate when the population is large (close to <m>M</m>). The updating function for the population then becomes
				<md>
					<mrow>p_{t+1} \amp=\text{per capita reproduction at time } t \cdot \text{population at time } t </mrow>
					<mrow>\amp= r_t \cdot p_t</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp=r\left(1- \dfrac{p_t}{M}\right) \cdot p_t</mrow>
				</md>.
			Thus, <m>p_{t+1}=r\left(1- \dfrac{p_t}{M}\right) \cdot p_t</m> is an updating function which models population size at year <m>t</m>, taking into account a maximum population size. Since we typically will not care about the actual value of <m>M</m>, but just the size of the population relative to <m>M</m>, we define the variable <m>x_t=\dfrac{p_t}{M}</m>, which gives the decimal percentage of the maximum population at year <m>t</m>. We can then re-write our updating function as 
				<md>
					<mrow>p_{t+1}=r\left(1- \dfrac{p_t}{M}\right) \cdot p_t</mrow>
					<mrow>\dfrac{1}{M} \cdot p_{t+1}=r\left(1- \dfrac{p_t}{M}\right) \cdot p_t \cdot \dfrac{1}{M} </mrow>
					<mrow>x_{t+1} = r(1-x_t) \cdot x_t</mrow>

		<subsection>
			<title>Equilibrium values and stability of the logistic map</title>
			<p>
			We now have a new model for population growth in the logistic map, but we don't know many details of how this system behaves outside of the general decrease in per capita reproduction with increase in population size that we built into the model. What are the equilibrium values of this system? How does the maximum per capita reproduction rate <m>r</m> impact their stability? What do the equilibrium values and their stability represent in the context of the model? 
			</p>
			<p>
			We know from <xref ref="sec-1-8">Section</xref> that we can find equilibrium values graphically or algebraically. Since our model contains a parameter and thus has no single graph to analyze, we will compute equilibrium values algebraically. Letting <m>x_{t+1}=x_t = x^*</m> in the updating function <m>x_{t+1}=rx_t(1-x_t)</m> gives <m>x^*=rx^*(1-x^*)</m>, or equivalently <m>x^*= rx^*-r(x^*)^2</m>. We now solve for <m>x^*</m>:
				<md>
					<mrow>x^*\amp= rx^*-r(x^*)^2</mrow>
					<mrow>r(x^*)^2+ x^*- rx^*\amp= 0 </mrow>
					<mrow>r(x^*)^2+ (1-r)x^*\amp= 0 </mrow>
					<mrow>x^*[rx^*+ (1-r)]\amp= 0 </mrow>
				</md>
			Thus we have two factors, <m>x^*</m> and <m>rx^*+ (1-r)</m> that multiply to <m>0</m>, meaning the zeros of both factors can give us an equilibrium value. The first equilibrium value is <m>x^*=0</m>, and the second equilibrium value is the solution to the equation <m>rx^*+ (1-r)=0</m>, which we solve as
				<md>
					<mrow>rx^*+ (1-r)\amp=0</mrow>
					<mrow>rx^* \amp=r-1</mrow>
					<mrow>x^* \amp = \dfrac{r-1}{r}</mrow>
				</md>.
			Division by <m>r</m> is valid since <m>r \gt 0</m>, and the second equilibrium value is only valid for <m>r \gt 1</m> since <m>x^*</m> represents a percentage and cannot be negative.
			</p>
			<p>
			We are now interested in classifying the stability of the equilibrium values <m>x^*=0</m> and <m>x^*=\dfrac{r-1}{r}</m>. Cob-webbing is not an ideal method, since our model contains a parameter and thus these equilibrium values represent many different systems (and graphs). Therefore, we will use the first derivative of the updating function rule to analyze stability using the Stability Theorem.
			</p>
			<p>
			The updating function rule of <m>x_{t+1} = rx_t(1-x_t)</m> is <m>f(x)=rx(1-x)</m>, or equivalently <m>f(x)=rx - rx^2</m>. The first derivative is then <m>f'(x)= r-2rx</m>. For the equilibrium value <m>x^*=0</m>, we compute
				<me>|f'(0)| = |r - 2r(0)| = |r|</me>.
			By the <xref ref="ass-3-2-stability" text="custom">Stability Theorem</xref>, <m>x^*=0</m> is stable when <m>|r| \lt 1</m>, which is equivalent to <m>-1 \lt r \lt 1</m>. Since <m>r \gt 0</m> in our model, <m>x^*=0</m> is stable when <m> 0 \lt r \lt 1</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
			For the equilibrium value <m>x^*=\dfrac{r-1}{r}</m>, we compute
				<me>\left| f'\left(\dfrac{r-1}{r}\right)\right| = \left| r - 2r\left(\dfrac{r-1}{r}\right)  \right| = |r -2(r-1) | = |2 -r|</me>.
			By the <xref ref="ass-3-2-stability" text="custom">Stability Theorem</xref>, <m>x^*= \dfrac{r-1}{r}</m> is stable when <m>|2-r| \lt 1</m>. To determine the exact bounds on <m>r</m>, we compute
				<md>
					<mrow> |2-r| \amp\lt 1, \text{ or}</mrow>
					<mrow> -1 \lt 2-r \amp\lt 1, \text{ or}</mrow>
					<mrow> -3 \lt -r \amp\lt -1, \text{ or}</mrow>
					<mrow>3 \gt r \amp\gt 1</mrow>
				</md>.
			Thus, <m>x^* = \dfrac{r-1}{r}</m> is stable when <m> 1 \lt r \lt 3</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
			We can summarize our analysis of the equilibrium values in the following table:
				<table>

			Note that our analysis does not say what happens when <m>r=1</m> or <m>r=3</m>, since these are cases in which the <xref ref="ass-3-2-stability" text="custom">Stability Theorem</xref> is inconclusive.

				<answer>
				The logistic dynamical system is the DTDS with updating function <m>x_{t+1} = rx_t(1-x_t)</m>. It can be used as a model for population growth which takes into account a maximum possible population, among other things.			<aside>
						<p>
						The logistic map has many other applications outside of population modeling, and its behavior contains some interesting and deep mathematics, particularly in the types of unstable behavior that can occur around equilibrium values. Though it is outside the scope of this course, you can see a brief introduction to the other aspects of the logistic map in <url href="https://www.veritasium.com/videos/2020/1/29/this-equation-will-change-how-you-see-the-world" visual="veritasium.com"> this video from Veritasium</url>.

				<question>How can we use calculus tools we've developed so far to understand how the logistic dynamical system behaves?</question>
				<answer>
				Since the logistic DTDS contains a parameter <m>r</m>, we cannot look at a single graph to analyze its behavior. Instead, we can compute equilibrium values algebraically and compute the derivative of the updating function, which gives us answers in terms of the parameter <m>r</m>. We can then analyze these expressions to determine how the parameter <m>r</m> effects the system's behavior. For example, we can use the Stability Theorem to determine which values of <m>r</m> make a given equilibrium value stable.

      A continuous function has a relative minimum at <m>c</m> if and only if the function changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>c</m>.
      (See <xref ref="F-3-1-extremes">Figure</xref>.)
      There are only two possible ways for these changes in behavior to occur:

          Since we already have <m>f'(x)</m> written in factored form,

          Because <m>f'(x)</m> is defined for all values of <m>x</m>,
          we need only determine where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.
          From the equation

          Next, to apply the first derivative test,

          Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which <m>f'</m> can change sign,
          it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers:
          for instance,
          the sign of <m>f'</m> must be the same for every <m>x \lt -1</m>.
          We create a first derivative sign chart to summarize the sign of <m>f'</m> on the relevant intervals,

        <p permid="ixd">
          To produce the first derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart">Figure</xref>
          we identify the sign of each factor of <m>f'(x)</m> at one selected point in each interval.
          For instance, for <m>x \lt -1</m>,
          we could determine the sign of <m>e^{-2x}</m>,
          <m>(3-x)</m>, and <m>(x+1)^2</m> at the value <m>x = -2</m>.
          We note that both <m>e^{-2x}</m> and <m>(x+1)^2</m> are positive regardless of the value of <m>x</m>,
          while <m>(3-x)</m> is also positive at <m>x = -2</m>.
          Hence, each of the three terms in <m>f'</m> is positive,
          which we indicate by writing <q><m>+++</m>.</q>
          Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for <m>f'</m>,
          which we denote by the <q><m>+</m></q>
          in the interval to the left of <m>x = -1</m>.
          And, since <m>f'</m> is positive on that interval,
          we know that <m>f</m> is increasing,
          so we write <q>INC</q>
          to represent the behavior of <m>f</m>.
          In a similar way,
          we find that <m>f'</m> is positive and <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>-1 \lt x \lt 3</m>,
          and <m>f'</m> is negative and <m>f</m> is decreasing for <m>x \gt 3</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="OEm">
          Now we look for critical numbers at which <m>f'</m> changes sign.
          In this example, <m>f'</m> changes sign only at <m>x = 3</m>,
          from positive to negative,
          so <m>f</m> has a relative maximum at <m>x = 3</m>.
          Although <m>f</m> has a critical number at <m>x = -1</m>,
          since <m>f</m> is increasing both before and after <m>x = -1</m>,
          <m>f</m> has neither a minimum nor a maximum at <m>x = -1</m>.

    <title>The second derivative test</title>
    <p permid="KEn">
      Recall that the second derivative of a function tells us several important things about the behavior of the function itself.
      For instance, if <m>f''</m> is positive on an interval,
      then we know that <m>f'</m> is increasing on that interval and,
      consequently, that <m>f</m> is concave up,
      so throughout that interval the tangent line to
      <m>y = f(x)</m> lies below the curve at every point.
      At a point where <m>f'(p) = 0</m>, 
      the sign of the second derivative determines whether <m>f</m> has a local minimum or local maximum at the critical number <m>p</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="qLw">
      In <xref ref="F-3-1-2Dtest">Figure</xref>,
      we see the four possibilities for a function <m>f</m> that has a critical number <m>p</m> at which <m>f'(p) = 0</m>,
      provided <m>f''(p)</m> is not zero on an interval including <m>p</m>
      (except possibly at <m>p</m>).
      On either side of the critical number,
      <m>f''</m> can be either positive or negative,
      and hence <m>f</m> can be either concave up or concave down.
      In the first two graphs,
      <m>f</m> does not change concavity at <m>p</m>, and in those situations,
      <m>f</m> has either a local minimum or local maximum.
      In particular, if <m>f'(p) = 0</m> and <m>f''(p) \lt 0</m>,
      then <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>p</m> with a horizontal tangent line,
      so <m>f</m> has a local maximum there.
      This fact, along with the corresponding statement for when <m>f''(p)</m> is positive,
      is the substance of the <em>second derivative test</em>.

      In the event that <m>f''(p) = 0</m>,
      the second derivative test is inconclusive.
      That is, the test doesn't provide us any information.

      it is possible that <m>f</m> has a local minimum,
      local maximum, or neither.<fn>

      Just as a first derivative sign chart reveals all of the increasing and decreasing behavior of a function,

          Since we know <m>f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2</m>,

          We see that <m>f</m> is increasing on the intervals

          and <m>f</m> is decreasing on
          <m>(-\sqrt{3},0)</m> and <m>(0, \sqrt{3})</m>.
          By the first derivative test,
          this information tells us that <m>f</m> has a local maximum at

          Although <m>f</m> also has a critical number at <m>x = 0</m>,
          neither a maximum nor minimum occurs there since <m>f'</m> does not change sign at <m>x = 0</m>.

        <p permid="ngW">
          Next, we move on to investigate concavity.
          Differentiating <m>f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2</m>,
          we see that <m>f''(x) = 12x^3 - 18x</m>.
          Since we are interested in knowing the intervals on which <m>f''</m> is positive and negative,
          we first find where <m>f''(x) = 0</m>.
          Observe that

          This equation has solutions <m>x = 0, \pm\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}</m>.
          Building a sign chart for <m>f''</m> in the exact same way we do for <m>f'</m>,
          we see the result shown in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart3">Figure</xref>.

          The point <m>A = (-\sqrt{3}, f(-\sqrt{3}))</m> is a local maximum,

          similarly, the point <m>E = (\sqrt{3}, f(\sqrt{3})</m> is a local minimum.
          Note, too, that <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>A</m> and concave up at <m>E</m>,
          which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test.
          At points <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>, concavity changes,
          as we saw in the results of the second derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart3">Figure</xref>.
          Finally, at point <m>C</m>,
          <m>f</m> has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line,
          but neither a maximum nor a minimum occurs there,
          since <m>f</m> is decreasing both before and after <m>C</m>.
          It is also the case that concavity changes at <m>C</m>.

          <answer>
            The critical numbers of a continuous function <m>f</m> are the values of <m>p</m> for which
            <m>f'(p) = 0</m> or <m>f'(p)</m> does not exist.
            These values are important because they identify horizontal tangent lines or corner points on the graph,

            whenever <m>f'</m> is negative, <m>f</m> is decreasing.
            The first derivative test tells us that at any point where <m>f</m> changes from increasing to decreasing,

            Given a twice differentiable function <m>f</m>,
            if we have a horizontal tangent line at <m>x = p</m> and <m>f''(p)</m> is nonzero,

            In particular, if <m>f'(p) = 0</m> and <m>f''(p) \lt 0</m>,
            then <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>p</m> and <m>f</m> has a local maximum there,

            If <m>f'(p) = 0</m> and <m>f''(p) = 0</m>,
            then the second derivative does not tell us whether <m>f</m> has a local extreme at <m>p</m> or not.

              From the given graph of <m>f'</m>,
              the first derivative sign chart for <m>f</m> shows that <m>f</m> has critical numbers at

              while being negative for all <m>x \lt -1</m>.

              and decreasing for <m>x \lt -1</m>.
              It follows by the first derivative test that <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = -1</m> because <m>f</m> changes from decreasing to increasing there.

              Based on where <m>f'(x)</m> has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative,
              we can sketch an approximate graph of
              <m>y = f''(x)</m> in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function.
              From the given graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
              we can see that <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>,
              and that between these points,

              while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else since <m>f'(x)</m> is increasing everywhere else.

              From our sketch of the second derivative in (b),

              In particular, we saw that
              <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>,
              and that between these points,
              <m>f''(x)</m> is negative, while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else.
              This shows that <m>f</m> is concave down for
              <m>-0.35 \lt x \lt 1</m> while being concave up everywhere else.
              We thus see that <m>f</m> has points of inflection at both <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and <m>x = 1</m>.

              we can sketch an approximate graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>.
              Note that we also know <m>f</m> has a horizontal tangent line at <m>x = 1</m> while being increasing on either side of <m>x = 1</m>,
              and earlier we established that <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x = -1</m>.

              In particular, <m>p</m> is concave down for

      We have seen that we can use the first derivative of a function to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing,
      and the second derivative to know where the function is concave up or concave down.
      This information helps us determine the overall shape and behavior of the graph,
      as well as whether the function has relative extrema.

      Remember the difference between a relative maximum and a global maximum:
      there is a <em>relative</em> maximum of <m>f</m> at <m>x = p</m> if

    <p permid="LCC">
      In <xref ref="F-3-3-Intro">Figure</xref>
      and <xref ref="PA-3-3">Warm-Up</xref>,
      we were interested in finding the global maximum for <m>f</m> on its entire domain. This example highlights a fact that will be useful for identifying global extrema on open intervals (for example, <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>):
      <theorem xml:id="thm-3-5-scp">
      	<title>Single Critical Point</title>
	<idx><h>single critical point theorem</h></idx>
	<p>
	If <m>f</m> is a continuous function on an interval <m>I</m> which contains a single critical number <m>x=c</m> in <m>I</m>, then
		<ul>
			<li>if <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>c</m>, <m>f</m> also has a <em>global</em> maximum at <m>c</m>, and</li>
			<li>if <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>c</m>, <m>f</m> also has a <em>global</em> minimum at <m>c</m>.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>	
      </theorem>
      In other contexts, however, we will focus on some restriction of the domain. When the restricted domain is closed (i.e., includes its endpoints), there is a mechanical process for determining the extreme values.
    </p>

    <p permid="rJL">
      For example, rather than considering
      <m>f(x) = 2 + \frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}</m> for every value of <m>x</m>,
      perhaps instead we are only interested in those <m>x</m> for which <m>0 \le x \le 4</m>,
      and we would like to know which values of <m>x</m> in the interval <m>[0,4]</m> produce the largest possible and smallest possible values of <m>f</m>.
      We are accustomed to critical numbers playing a key role in determining the location of extreme values of a function;
      now, by restricting the domain to an interval,
      it makes sense that the endpoints of the interval will also be important to consider,
      as we see in the following activity.
      When limiting ourselves to a particular interval,
      we will often refer to the <em>absolute</em>
      maximum or minimum value,
      rather than the <em>global</em> maximum or minimum.

      In <xref ref="act-3-3-1">Activity</xref>,
      we saw how the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed,
      bounded interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      depend not only on the critical numbers of the function,
      but also on the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      These observations demonstrate several important facts that hold more generally.
      First, we state an important result called the Extreme Value Theorem.

        then <m>f</m> attains both an absolute minimum and absolute maximum on <m>[a,b]</m>.
        That is, for some value <m>x_m</m> such that <m>a \le x_m \le b</m>,
        it follows that <m>f(x_m) \le f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>.
        Similarly, there is a value <m>x_M</m> in <m>[a,b]</m> such that
        <m>f(x_M) \ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>.
        Letting <m>m = f(x_m)</m> and <m>M = f(x_M)</m>,

      The Extreme Value Theorem tells us that 
      on any closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      a continuous function has to achieve both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum.
      The theorem does not tell us where these extreme values occur,
      but rather only that they must exist.
      As we saw in <xref ref="act-3-3-1">Activity</xref>,
      the only possible locations for absolute extremes are at the endpoints of the interval or at a critical number.

            Here,

            not a closed bounded interval.
            Hence,
            we need to think about the overall behavior of the function.
            First, since <m>f(x) = 4 - e^{-(x-2)^2}</m>,
            by the chain rule we see that <m>f'(x) = -e^{-(x-2)^2}(-2(x-2)) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}</m>.
            Since <m>e^{-(x-2)^2}</m> is always positive
            (in particular, never zero),
            it follows that the only critical number of <m>f</m> is <m>x = 2</m>.
            Furthermore, with <m>f'(x) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}</m>,
            we see that for <m>x \lt 2</m>,
            <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m>, while for <m>x \gt 2</m>, <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m>.
            This tells us by the first derivative test that <m>f</m> is decreasing for <m>x \lt 2</m> and increasing for <m>x \gt 2</m>,
            which tells us that <m>f</m> has an absolute minimum at <m>x = 2</m>,

      illustrate standard steps that we undertake in almost every applied optimization problem:
      we draw a picture to demonstrate the situation,
      introduce one or more variables to represent quantities that are changing,
      find a function that models the quantity to be optimized,
      and then decide on an appropriate domain for that function.
      Once that is done,
      we are in the familiar situation of finding the absolute minimum and maximum of a function over a particular domain,
      so we apply the calculus ideas that we have been studying in this section.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We complete this section with a final optimization application relevant to foraging individuals in a system where food is obtained in discrete spaces which require time to travel between. One example is a bee traveling between flowers for nectar. If the bee's goal is to maximize its average food collection rate per flower, it must decide whether to stay on the current flower, where its rate of food collection is decreasing as the nectar is depleted, or travel to another flower with more nectar, but lose the time it takes to travel there.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To find the optimal amount of time the bee should stay on each flower, we must determine a model for the quantity we'd like to maximize, the bee's average food collection rate per flower after <m>t</m> seconds, which we will call <m>r(t)</m>. This includes the non-zero travel time it takes to get to another flower, which we will call <m>\tau</m>. Assume <m>f(t)</m> is the amount of food collected after <m>t</m> seconds on a flower, and that <m>f(t)</m> is continuous and satisfies <m>f''(t) \lt 0 </m>. This last assumption means <m>f</m> is concave down, or that the bee's food collection rate on the flower decreases as time goes on and nectar is depleted. We can then write <m>r(t)</m> as 
    	<me>r(t) = \dfrac{\text{food collected after }t \text{ seconds on flower}}{\text{total time before next flower}} = \dfrac{f(t)}{t + \tau}</me>.
	The domain of <m>r(t)</m> is the interval <m>[0,\infty)</m>. To find the maximum value of <m>r</m> on this domain we first search for critical numbers of <m>r</m> in <m>[0,\infty)</m>. We compute the first derivative of <m>r</m> as
		<me>r'(t) = \dfrac{f'(t)(t+\tau) - f(t) \cdot 1}{(t+\tau)^2} </me>
	Note that the denominator is always positive, so <m>r'(t)</m> is not undefined in the domain <m>[0,\infty)</m>. Thus, <m>t_c</m> is a critical number if <m>r'(t_c)=0</m>, which is true when <m>f'(t_c)(t_c+\tau) - f(t_c) =0</m>. This is equivalent to <m>f'(t_c)(t_c+\tau) = f(t_c)</m>, which is equivalent to 
		<me>f'(t_c) = \dfrac{f(t_c)}{t_c+\tau} = r(t_c)</me>.
	In words, this says that if a time <m>t_c</m> is a critical number, then the instantaneous rate of change of the bee's food collection on the flower at time <m>t_c</m> is the same as the bee's average collection rate over the <m>(t_c + \tau)</m> seconds it takes to be on the next flower. To verify that a maximum value occurs at a critical number <m>t_c</m>, the assumption that <m>f''(t) \lt 0</m> is important. It is a good exercise in computing derivatives to verify that if we compute <m>r''(t)</m>, evaluate <m>r''(t_c)</m> and then simplify, we get
		<me>r''(t_c) = \dfrac{f''(t_c)}{t_c + \tau}</me>.
	Since <m>t_c + \tau \gt 0</m> and under the assumption that <m>f''(t_c) \lt 0</m>, this means that <m>r''(t_c) \lt 0</m>. Hence, by the second derivative test, a local maximum of <m>r(t)</m> occurs at the critical number <m>t_c</m>. Further, every critical number <m>t_c</m> in the domain <m>[0,\infty)</m> satisfies this property, and so every critical number in <m>[0,\infty)</m> is a local maximum. Since <m>r(t)</m> is a continuous function on the domain <m>[0,\infty)</m>, there can only be one such critical point. By <xref ref="thm-3-5-scp">Fact</xref>, a global maximum of <m>r(t)</m> also occurs at the critical number <m>t_c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
    This general result is known as the <em>Marginal Value Theorem</em>, and is summarized below:
    </p>
    <theorem>
    	<title>Marginal Value Theorem</title>
	<idx><h>marginal value theorem</h></idx>
	<p>
	We have a system of foraging individuals in which there is a constant travel time <m>\tau \gt 0 </m> to get from one source to the next. Let <m>f(t)</m> represent the amount of intake of a resource after time <m>t</m> spent on a source. Assume <m>f(t)</m> is continuous and <m>f''(t)\lt 0</m>. Let <m>r(t) = \dfrac{f(t)}{t+ \tau}</m> be the average collection rate after spending time <m>t</m> on a single source. Then the time <m>t_c</m> an individual should spend on a single source in order to maximize its average collection rate <m>r(t)</m> satisfies
		<me>f'(t_c) = r(t_c)</me>.
	</p>
    </theorem>
    <p>
    Intuitively, the Marginal Value Theorem says that a bee should leave a flower the instant before its instantaneous collection rate drops below the average collection rate; that is, the bee should leave when it can do better on a different flower.
    </p>
   <example>
   	<title>Marginal Value Theorem</title>
	<p>
	Suppose the food collection function for a bee is <m>f(t) = \dfrac{t}{0.5+t}</m>, and the travel time between flowers is <m>\tau=1</m> second. Then the average collection rate after <m>t</m> seconds is given by 
		<me>r(t) = \dfrac{t}{(0.5+t)(t+1)} </me>.
	It is a good exercise to verify that the only positive critical number of <m>r(t)</m> is <m>t_c = \sqrt{0.5}</m>, and that <m>f'( \sqrt{0.5}) = r( \sqrt{0.5})</m>. The interactive below shows a visualization of the Marginal Value Theorem in this example:
		<interactive desmos="xen906mmtt" width="170%" aspect="2:1" preview="images/3_5_int_prev_mvt.png"/>
	At times <m>t</m> when the bee is instantaneously doing better than average (<m>0 \leq t \lt \sqrt{0.5}</m>), the bee should stay on the flower. This is when the slope of the tangent line at <m>t</m> is steeper than the slope of the secant line over <m>t+1</m> seconds. At times <m>t</m> when the bee is instantaneously doing worse than average (<m>t \gt \sqrt{0.5}</m>), the bee would have done better to leaver earlier.

	How does the travel time <m>\tau</m> impact when the bee should leave a flower? Answer the questions below based on your intuition, then use the interactive to confirm or deny your answer.
		<ul>
			<li>
				If the travel time is larger than <m>1</m>, should the bee leave sooner or later than it does when the travel time is <m>1</m> second?
				<answer>
				When the travel time is larger, there is more incentive to stay on the current flower, so the bee should leave later than when the travel time is <m>1</m> second.
				</answer>
			</li>
			<li>
				If the travel time is smaller than <m>1</m>, should the bee leave sooner or later than it does when the travel time is <m>1</m> second?
				<answer>
				When the travel time is smaller, there is more incentive to leave the current flower, so the bee should leave sooner than when the travel time is <m>1</m> second.

          <question permid="MHV"> What are the differences between finding relative extreme values and global extreme values of a function?</question>
          <answer>
            To find relative extreme values of a function,
            we use a first derivative sign chart and classify all of the function's critical numbers.
            If instead we are interested in absolute extreme values,
            we first decide whether we are considering the entire domain of the function or a particular interval.

          <question permid="sPe">How is the process of finding the global maximum or minimum of a function over the function's entire domain different from determining the global maximum or minimum on a restricted domain?</question>
          <answer>
            In the case of finding global extremes over the function's entire domain,
            we will typically see models that contain a single critical number in the domain. In this case we use <xref ref="thm-3-5-scp">Fact</xref> to help determine the global extrema we're interested in.
            If we are working to find absolute extremes on a restricted interval,
            then we first identify all critical numbers of the function that lie in the interval.

          <question permid="YWn">For a function that is guaranteed to have both a global maximum and global minimum on a closed,
          bounded interval,
          what are the possible points at which these extreme values occur?
          </question>
          <answer>
            For a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval,
            the only possible points at which absolute extreme values occur are the critical numbers and the endpoints.
            Thus, we simply evaluate the function at each endpoint and each critical number in the interval,
            and compare the results to decide which is largest
            (the absolute maximum)
            and which is smallest
            (the absolute minimum).

              Evaluating <m>p</m> at the endpoints and the critical number within the interval,

              Hence, the absolute maximum of <m>p</m> on <m>[0,a]</m> is

  <introduction permid="job">
    <p permid="JFY">
      Because differential calculus is based on the definition of the derivative,
      and the definition of the derivative involves a limit,
      there is a sense in which all of calculus rests on limits.
      In addition,
      the limit involved in the definition of the derivative always generates the <em>indeterminate form</em> <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
      If <m>f</m> is a differentiable function,
      then in the definition
      <me permid="CLt">
        f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
      </me>,
      not only does <m>h \to 0</m> in the denominator,
      but also <m>(f(x+h)-f(x)) \to 0</m> in the numerator,
      since <m>f</m> is continuous.
      Remember, saying that a limit has an indeterminate form only means that we don't yet know its value and have more work to do:
      indeed, limits of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> can take on any value,
      as is evidenced by evaluating <m>f'(x)</m> for varying values of <m>x</m> for a function such as <m>f'(x) = x^2</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="pNh">
      In <xref ref="ch-2">Chapter</xref>, we learned many techniques for evaluating the limits that result from the derivative definition,
      including a large number of shortcut rules.
      In this section, we turn the situation upside-down:
      instead of using limits to evaluate derivatives,
      we explore how to use derivatives to evaluate certain limits.

    <p permid="VUq">
      The idea demonstrated in <xref ref="PA-2-8">Warm-Up</xref>
      <mdash /> that we can evaluate an indeterminate limit of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> by replacing each of the numerator and denominator with their local linearizations at the point of interest <mdash /> can be generalized in a way that enables us to evaluate a wide range of limits.
      We have a function <m>h(x)</m> that can be written as a quotient
      <m>h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m>,
      where <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both differentiable at <m>x=a</m> and for which <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m>.
      We would like to evaluate the indeterminate limit given by
      <m>\lim_{x \to a} h(x)</m>.
      <xref ref="F-2-8-LHR">Figure</xref> illustrates the situation.
      We see that both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have an <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x = a</m>.
      Their respective tangent line approximations <m>L_f</m> and <m>L_g</m> at <m>x = a</m>
      are also shown in the figure.
      We can take advantage of the fact that a function and its tangent line approximation become indistinguishable as <m>x \to a</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Cbz">
      First, let's recall that <m>L_f(x) = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)</m> and <m>L_g(x) = g'(a)(x-a) +g(a)</m>.
      Because <m>x</m> is getting arbitrarily close to <m>a</m> when we take the limit,
      we can replace <m>f</m> with <m>L_f</m> and replace <m>g</m> with <m>L_g</m>,
      and thus we observe that
      <md permid="iSC">
        <mrow>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)}{g'(a)(x-a) + g(a)}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="iiI">
      Next, we remember that both <m>f(a) = 0</m> and <m>g(a) = 0</m>,
      which is precisely what makes the original limit indeterminate.
      Substituting these values for <m>f(a)</m> and <m>g(a)</m> in the limit above,
      we now have
      <md permid="vgU">
        <mrow>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a)}{g'(a)(x-a)}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</mrow>
      </md>,
      where the latter equality holds because
      <m>\frac{x-a}{x-a} = 1</m> when <m>x</m> is approaching
      (but not equal to) <m>a</m>.
      Finally, we note that <m>\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</m> is constant with respect to <m>x</m>, and thus
      <me permid="OZL">
        \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OpR">
      This result holds as long as <m>g'(a)</m> is not equal to zero.
      The formal name of the result is L'Hôpital's Rule.

        Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be differentiable at <m>x=a</m>,

        Then <m>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</m>.

    <p permid="aEj">
      In practice,
      we typically work with a slightly more general version of L'Hôpital's Rule,

      </me>,
      provided the righthand limit exists.
      This form reflects the basic idea of L'Hôpital's Rule:
      if <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> produces an indeterminate limit of form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> as <m>x \to a</m>,
      that limit is equivalent to the limit of the quotient of the two functions' derivatives,
      <m>\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="GLs">
      For example,
      if we consider the limit from <xref ref="PA-2-8">Warm-Up</xref>,
      <me permid="Hvm">
        \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1}

      by L'Hôpital's Rule we have that
      <me permid="nCv">
        \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{5x^4 + 1}{2x} = \frac{6}{2} = 3. \\
      </me>
    </p>

    <p permid="mSB">
      By replacing the numerator and denominator with their respective derivatives,

    <title>Limits involving <m>\infty</m></title>
    <p permid="XJD">
      The concept of infinity,
          <idx><h>infinity</h></idx>
      denoted <m>\infty</m>, arises naturally in calculus,
      as it does in much of mathematics.
      It is important to note from the outset that <m>\infty</m> is a concept,
      but not a number itself.
      Indeed, the notion of <m>\infty</m> naturally invokes the idea of limits.
      Consider, for example, the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>,
      whose graph is pictured in <xref ref="F-2-8-Infty">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p permid="DQM">
      We note that <m>x = 0</m> is not in the domain of <m>f</m>,
      so we may naturally wonder what happens as <m>x \to 0</m>.
      As <m>x \to 0^+</m>, we observe that <m>f(x)</m>
      <em>increases without bound</em>.
      That is, we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> closer and closer
      (but not equal)
      to 0, while keeping <m>x \gt 0</m>.
      This is a good way to think about what infinity represents:
      a quantity is tending to infinity if there is no single number that the quantity is always less than.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-2-8-Infty" permid="KpS">

      	<description>The graph of the function one divided by x. </description>
      </image>
    </figure>

    <p permid="jXV">
      Recall that the statement <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L</m>,
      means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to <m>a</m>.
      We now expand this notation and language to include the possibility that either <m>L</m> or <m>a</m> can be <m>\infty</m>.
      For instance, for <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, we now write
      <me permid="zQN">
        \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty
      </me>,
      by which we mean that we can make
      <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to 0.
      In a similar way, we write
      <me permid="fXW">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0
      </me>,
      <notation><usage><m> \lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)</m></usage><description>The limit of <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> gets arbitrarily large</description></notation>
      since we can make <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as close to 0 as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large (i.e., by letting <m>x</m> increase without bound).
    </p>

    <p permid="Qfe">
      In general, the notation
      <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty</m> means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to <m>a</m>, and the notation
      <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L</m>  means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large.
      This notation also applies to left- and right-hand limits,
      and to limits involving <m>-\infty</m>.
      For example, returning to <xref ref="F-2-8-Infty">Figure</xref>
      and <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, we can say that
      <me permid="Mff">
        \lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="wmn">
      Finally, we write
      <me permid="smo">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \infty
      </me>
      if we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large.
      For example,
      <me permid="Ytx">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} x^2 = \infty
      </me>.

      of a function.
      If <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty</m>,
      then <m>x = a</m> is a vertical asymptote of <m>f</m>,
      while if <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L</m>,
      then <m>y = L</m> is a horizontal asymptote of <m>f</m>.
      Similar statements can be made using <m>-\infty</m>,

    <p permid="IAF">
      In precalculus classes,
      it is common to study the <em>end behavior</em>
      of certain families of functions,

      Here we briefly examine some familiar functions and note the values of several limits involving <m>\infty</m>.

      For the natural exponential function <m>e^x</m>,
      we note that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} e^x = \infty</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} e^x = 0</m>.
      For the exponential decay function <m>e^{-x}</m>,
      these limits are reversed,
      with <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} e^{-x} = 0</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} e^{-x} = \infty</m>.
      Turning to the natural logarithm function,
      we have <m>\lim_{x \to 0^+} \ln(x) = -\infty</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \ln(x) = \infty</m>.
      While both <m>e^x</m> and <m>\ln(x)</m> grow without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>,
      the exponential function does so much more quickly than the logarithm function does.
      We'll soon use limits to quantify what we mean by <q>quickly.</q>

      For polynomial functions of the form
      <me permid="EAG">
        p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots a_1 x + a_0
      </me>,
      the end behavior depends on the sign of <m>a_n</m> and whether the highest power <m>n</m> is even or odd.
      If <m>n</m> is even and <m>a_n</m> is positive,
      then <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} p(x) = \infty</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = \infty</m>,
      as in the plot of <m>g</m> in <xref ref="F-2-8-InftyLib">Figure</xref>.
      If instead <m>a_n</m> is negative,
      then <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} p(x) = -\infty</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = -\infty</m>.
      In the situation where <m>n</m> is odd,
      then either <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} p(x) = \infty</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = -\infty</m>
      (which occurs when <m>a_n</m> is positive,

      or <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} p(x) = -\infty</m> and
      <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = \infty</m>
      (when <m>a_n</m> is negative).

    <p permid="AWg">
      A function can fail to have a limit as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
      For example,
      consider the plot of the sine function at right in <xref ref="F-2-8-InftyLib">Figure</xref>.
      Because the function continues oscillating between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>,
      we say that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \sin(x)</m> does not exist.

          Here we say that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} q(x)</m> has indeterminate form <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>.
          We can determine the value of this limit through a standard algebraic approach.
          Multiplying the numerator and denominator each by <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m>,

      To evaluate the limit of a quotient of two functions

            Derivatives can be used to help us evaluate indeterminate limits of the form
            <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> through L'Hôpital's Rule,
            by replacing the functions in the numerator and denominator with their tangent line approximations.
            In particular,
            if <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m> and <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable at <m>a</m>, L'Hôpital's Rule tells us that

          <answer>
            When we write <m>x \to \infty</m>,

        In addition, the denominator is zero

They can help us answer questions like <q>is the population headed towards extinction?</q> and <q>what is the baseline concentration of a substance in the bloodstream?</q>. We were introduced to basic limits of this form in <xref ref="ssec-3-6-limitsinfty">Subsection</xref>.

		<title>Leading Behavior at <m>\infty</m></title>
		<p>
		In <xref ref="wu-3-7">Warm-Up</xref> we observed a complicated function built as the sum of simpler functions can exhibit <em>local behavior</em> that is complicated to predict without computation, like its zeros and its local extrema. However, if we are interested in describing the <em>end behavior</em> of such a function, as we are in this section, it can be predicted based on the behavior of a single simpler function. Indeed, if <m>f(x) = f_1(x) + f_2(x) + f_3(x)</m>, and <m>|f_1(x)|</m> dominates <m>|f_2(x)|</m> and <m>|f_3(x)|</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>, then the graph of <m>f</m> will start to behave like the graph of <m>f_1</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>. For such a function, we give the dominant term a special name.
		</p>
		<definition>
			<idx><h>leading behaviors</h><h>at <m>\infty</m></h></idx>
			 <notation><usage><m>f_\infty(x)</m></usage><description>The leading behavior of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>\infty</m></description></notation>
			<p>
			Let <m>f(x)</m> be a sum of functions. If one function in the sum dominates all of the other functions in the sum in absolute value as <m>x \to \infty</m>, we call this function <term>the leading behavior of <m>f</m> at <m>\infty</m></term>. We denote the leading behavior of <m>f</m> at <m>\infty</m> as <m>f_\infty(x)</m>.
			</p>
		</definition>
		<p>
		Note that leading behavior is determined by which term dominates <em>in absolute value</em>. A term being positive or negative can impact the value of the limit, but it does not effect whether or not a term is the leading behavior. As we described above, the leading behavior of a function at <m>\infty</m> can be useful in evaluating limits at infinity: 
		</p>
		<assemblage>
			<title>Leading Behavior at <m>\infty</m></title>
			<p>
			Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function with leading behavior at <m>\infty</m> <m>f_\infty(x)</m>. Then
				<me>\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} f_\infty(x)</me>.
			</p>
		</assemblage>
		<p>
		The benefit of leading behaviors is that it allows us to replace a complicated function with a simpler one that has the same end behavior.
		</p>
		<example>
			<title>Leading Behavior at <m>\infty</m></title>
			<p>
			Let <m>g(x) = -x^3 - \sqrt{x} + \ln(x)</m> and <m>h(x)= e^{-x} +2^x + x^{100}</m>. In <xref ref="sec-2-8-LHR">Section</xref> we determined that as <m>x \to \infty</m>, exponential growth dominates power growth dominates logarithmic growth. Therefore, we know that <m>g_\infty(x) = -x^3</m>, since <m>|-x^3|</m> dominates the other terms as <m>x \to \infty</m>. Also, <m>h_\infty(x) = 2^x</m> since exponential growth dominates power function growth. We must be careful to notice here that the leading behavior at infinity is not <m>e^{-x}</m>, since this function decays to <m>0</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
			</p>

		<title>Leading Behavior at <m>-\infty</m></title>
		<p>
		Leading behavior at <m>-\infty</m> is defined similarly to leading behavior at <m>\infty</m>:

			<p>
			Let <m>f(x)</m> be a sum of functions. If one function in the sum dominates all of the other functions in the sum in absolute value as <m>x \to -\infty</m>, we call this function <term>the leading behavior of <m>f</m> at <m>-\infty</m></term>. We denote the leading behavior of <m>f</m> at <m>-\infty</m> as <m>f_{-\infty}(x)</m>.

		We can also use <m>f_{-\infty}(x)</m> similarly to help us evaluate limit as <m>x \to -\infty</m>:

			<title>Leading Behavior at <m>-\infty</m></title>
			<p>
			Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function with leading behavior at <m>-\infty</m> <m>f_{-\infty}(x)</m>. Then
				<me>\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} f_{-\infty}(x)</me>.
			</p>
		</assemblage>
		The main thing we must be careful of with leading behaviors at <m>-\infty</m> is to pay attention to the behavior of the function as <m>x \to -\infty</m>; that is, as we move to the left on the graph of the function. This behavior is in general different than the behavior as <m>x \to \infty</m> (as we move to the right on the graph of the function). For example, <m>e^x</m> is a common leading behavior at <m>\infty</m> because it is exponential growth, and gets large quickly as <m>x \to \infty</m>. However, it is not a common leading behavior at <m>-\infty</m> since it decays to <m>0</m> as <m>x \to -\infty</m>: <m>\lim_{x \to -\infty} e^x = 0</m>.

		<example>
			<title>Leading Behavior at <m>-\infty</m></title>
			<p>
			Let <m>g(x) = -x^3 - \sqrt[3]{x} + \ln(-x)</m> and <m>h(x)= e^{-x} +2^x + x^{100}</m>. Then <m>g_{-\infty}(x) = -x^3</m>, since <m>|-x^3|</m> dominates the other terms as <m>x \to -\infty</m>.  For <m>h(x)</m>, note that <m>2^x</m> gets very small as <m>x \to -\infty</m>. The function <m>x^{100}</m> gets very large as <m>x \to -\infty</m>, but is power function growth. The function <m>e^{-x}</m> grows exponentially as <m>x \to -\infty</m>. Thus, <m>h_{-\infty}(x) = e^{-x}</m>.

			We can use leading behaviors to evaluate the limit of the ratio of <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>:
				<me>\lim_{x \to -\infty} \dfrac{-x^3 - \sqrt[3]{x} + \ln(-x)}{e^{-x} +2^x + x^{100}} = \lim_{x \to -\infty} \dfrac{g_{-\infty}(x)}{h_{-\infty}(x)} = \lim_{x \to -\infty} \dfrac{-x^3}{e^{-x}} = 0</me>,
			since <m>e^{-x}</m> dominates <m>|-x^3|</m> as <m>x \to -\infty</m>.
